<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the Anomalya.fr clone from scratch, starting with a React frontend (Shadcn UI) and mock data, then transitioning to a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. Key architectural decisions included modular FastAPI routers, JWT-based authentication, and a React Context for frontend state. The work progressed through several phases: initial frontend development, backend integration, a complete user authentication system, and an extensive admin panel. The engineer iteratively debugged issues, primarily around API response handling (e.g.,  vs ), and fixed reported bugs like the broken news display and non-functional homepage buttons. An advanced Admin Analytics Dashboard was then implemented, involving new components and real-time database integration. Crucially, comprehensive project documentation (CHANGELOG.md, README.md) and development infrastructure (scripts, templates, Docker setup, tests) were added to fulfill user requests for a complete project. Currently, the engineer is integrating an Enhanced Content Management system (Rich Text Editor, Media Manager) into the admin panel, focusing on article management and backend media APIs.

<product_requirements>
The user's core requirement is to clone and enhance , focusing on visual replication and feature expansion. Initial goals included a News System enhancement (categories, search, pagination), general site improvements (responsiveness, animations), a FastAPI/MongoDB backend for all content, an Admin Panel for site management, and a comprehensive User/Client System (login, loyalty points, client data).

Current status reflects significant progress: a responsive frontend clone of  is complete, dynamically served by a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. A JWT-based authentication system with admin functionality exists. Core authentication pages and admin panels (, , ) are implemented. A robust client system with loyalty points, dashboards, profile, quote/ticket management pages, and corresponding admin panels (, , ) are functional. All reported bugs regarding news display, homepage buttons, and analytics data accuracy have been addressed. Comprehensive documentation (CHANGELOG.md, README.md) and development infrastructure (scripts, templates, Docker setup, tests) have also been added. The project is now moving into advanced admin features, specifically content management.

<current_work>
The Anomalya Corp application is a fully functional full-stack platform with extensive public, client, and admin interfaces. All core public pages are complete and populated by backend data. The JWT-based authentication system is functional for both admin () and client users. The comprehensive admin panel includes , , and a newly implemented  (which now displays real data from the database, not simulated). The client system (dashboard, profile, quotes, tickets) is robust. All previously reported bugs related to news display on the homepage and news pages, the Lire la suite and En savoir plus buttons on the homepage, and the inaccurate analytics data have been successfully fixed and validated. Comprehensive documentation, including  and , along with all supporting development infrastructure (config files, installation scripts, content templates, tests, Docker setup), has been added to make the project production-ready.

The AI engineer is currently working on **Feature 2: Enhanced Content Management**. This involves integrating the  and  components into the  page (previously ) to provide a rich content editing experience for articles. Backend endpoints for media management have been created in , integrated into , and corresponding API calls added to . Necessary Python dependencies (, ) have been installed. The frontend component  has been updated to use the real media APIs. The last action involved attempting to test the newly integrated features, specifically the backend media APIs, which currently require proper authentication.
